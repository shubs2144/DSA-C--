 - def - Data structures are ways to organize and store data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They are essential for designing efficient algorithms and managing large amounts of data.

 - Database - managing data in a permanent memory, such as a hard drive or SSD, using structures like B-Trees or R-Trees for indexing and retrieval.

 - Data warehouses - large storage systems that aggregate data from different sources,

 - Big Data - refers to data sets that are so large or complex that traditional data processing applications are inadequate. Big Data technologies often use distributed data structures and processing frameworks.
