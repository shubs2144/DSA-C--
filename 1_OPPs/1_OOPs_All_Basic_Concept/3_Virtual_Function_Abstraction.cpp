// âœ… Best Practices to Follow

// 1. Use override keyword
// ðŸ“Œ Use override always when overriding virtual methods â€” it catches mistakes at compile time.

// 2. Use virtual in base class
// You already did this correctly!

/* More Theory

Virtual functions are defined in a base class and can be redefined in derived classes, enabling runtime polymorphism.

They allow executing the most derived version of a function when called through a base class pointer or reference.

If a derived class does not implement its own version, the base class implementation will be executed instead.

To declare a virtual function, precede its declaration in the base class with the keyword virtual.

Virtual functions are useful when you don't know the type of the object at compile time and you want to call a function of a derived class using a pointer of a base class.


ðŸ§  What is a Base Class in C++?
A base class (also called a parent or superclass) is the class that provides common properties and behaviors which can be inherited by other classes.

ðŸ“˜ Definition:
A base class is a class that is used to define a common interface or behavior and is inherited by one or more derived classes.
